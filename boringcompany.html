                    <div class="article-text">Cities all over the world encounter many problems concering mobility. Traffic seems to be stuck from 7AM to 7PM.
                    Many people think they know a solution: investments in public transportation, motivate people to use the bike, add extra lanes to the highways,...
                Elon Musk takes his solution to the next level: in 2017 he started digging tunnels for the transportation of cars.
                The reasoning behind his solution is rather simple. People live and work in 3D-buildings with multiple floors. However, all those people need to transport
                themselves on a 2D-surface. As all these people move around the same time of the day, traffic gets stuck: the 2D-surface hasn't enough capacity to fill the 3D-buildings.
                That's why Musk thinks it is necessary to add an extra dimension to our space of transport. He doesn't believe
                in flying cars because people on the ground wouldn't be at ease with a 100 flying cars above their heads.

                        The Boring Company uses advanced boring machines to make the tunnels.
                        Their most recent machine is 15 times as fast as conventional boring machines, like the one used for digging the tunnel under The Channel.
                        When the project was launched, Musk was thinking to use the tunnels for the transportation of cars. Due to efficiency-reasons, Musk came back from this idea.
                        The Boring Company dedided on also using the tunnels for passenger-shuttles. Did Musk just reinvent the subway-system? Only partly, because the tunnels are going to be put under vacuum,
                        which should avoid as much as resistance as possible.The shuttles could reach speeds about 200km/h, which is faster than any existing subway-system.

                    <div class="article-text"> The Boring Company is currently working on several projects, mostly based in the United States.
                        In Los Angeles there are three projects pending. Although facing legal and social barriers, The Hawthorne Test Tunnel had its first succesful run in December 2018.
                        The Boring Company also proposed the building of a tunnel between New York and Washington D.C. Right now, it takes 4 hours by car and 3 hours by train to make the connection.
                        The new tunnel would bring passengers from NY to DC in about 30 minutes. Unfortunately, government approval is still lacking at the moment. <br><br>
                        The most important innovation that The Boring Company brings to the world is the improved boring technology. Other companies are not necessarely
                        interested in the vacuum-tunnels. They are in awe of the speed at which The Boring Company can digg tunnels. The CERN-institute has had conversations with The Boring Company about digging the
                        tunnels for a new particle collider, named the Future Circural Collider.
