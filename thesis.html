                    <div class="article-text">Anti-Americanism is a widely discussed theme in a variety of countries. There seems to be no
existing research on anti-Americanism in Belgium. This paper tries to fill the gap by examining
newspaper articles on the United States in the Communist Press. As many authors state that the
“Americanization” of Europe started in 1945, the paper focusses on the period 1946-1947. The
articles are being sorted and analyzed using four categories of anti-Americanism. These
categories are derived from the existing literature. For 1946, there are almost no examples of
anti-Americanism. In 1947, following on the Truman-doctrine and the Marshall plan, the
Communist press formulates highly critical discourse on the United States. This critique is
more of an anti-big powerism than a critique of “Americanization”.  <br><br>
