                         With the risk of regretting it within the next day, I made a list of five books I can highly recommend.
                          My number one ended up being "The Story of Art" by E.H. Gombrich.
                          From the hunter-gatherers making cave-art to the 19th-century impressionists, Gombrich covers them all as if he's telling one exciting story.
                          Gombrich's work is as engaging as any fiction book could be. Here is my ranking of my other favourites     </div>

                        <li> The Story of Art - E.H. Gombrich </li>

                    <div class="article-text"> My top-5 in songs evolves even faster than my taste for books. You can assume that the following list
                        is put together quite randomly. Lately I've been listening a lot to Queens of The Stone Age and the old Eminem-Dr.Dre stuff.
                          The music of that first group is known for its consistent quality (something we can not say about Eminem, unfortunately).
                            You can almost hear the American desert in the music of QotSA, where they record a lot of their music. Yes, I like guitars.
                            Fun Fact: the last book from my booklist, inspired Mick Jagger to write the last song in this list!

                    <div class="article-text"> The choice for my top-5 in series has been relatively easy. Last year I watched every new Game of Thrones
                        episode at the moment they were released: at 3:00 A.M., sundaynight. Luckily I was accompanied by my girlfriend.
                         It cost us a lot of higly-appreciated sleep but we simply didn't want to get spoiled. Contrary to almost everyone I know (and IMDB), I didn't find
                         Season 8 to be a bad one . Okay, it was a bit rushed but could anyone predict the ending? Feel free to debate me during the breaks at Switchfully ;).
                         Second on the list is Westworld. Season 1 topped season 2, but in general the quality remained the same. I can't wait for season 3, which comes out in spring this year.
                         I promise I won't dodge any sleep for the new episodes.

                        Instead, I like to go to small bars with some friends or my girlfriend. Although I enjoy some wines, I prefer
                        our Belgian beer. First on the list is La Chouffe. It's the first strong beer I ever got to drink and the love for it
                        has never diminished.
